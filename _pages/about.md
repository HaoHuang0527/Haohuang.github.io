I am an undergraduate student majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hkust.edu.hk/).

My interests lie in the development of computer vision. I worked on a research project focused on integrating BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre-training) and Noice Collage within the Stable Diffusion framework to enhance AI-driven image generation. This involves experimenting with BLIP to improve text-to-image alignment by leveraging its advanced semantic understanding capabilities, while simultaneously utilizing Noice Collage to curate and blend visual elements for dynamic compositions. I have been fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models to test the synergy between these tools and analyzing the generated outputs. Additionally, I am proficient in techniques such as prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, latent space exploration, and blending methods to optimize image quality. Furthermore, I am comfortable using Python-based libraries such as PyTorch and Hugging Face, alongside tools like CLIP and BLIP for model integration and performance evaluation.
